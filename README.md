### Installation

### Note Regarding waveform generation
- Currently, generating waveform takes ~8 seconds for a 3 min track, I'm limited by the technology of my time, though that being said, once the waveform is generated, it is cached permanently, meaning you will not have to wait again.
- Due to that, I've provided an option to generate all waveforms at once, maybe u can use it on a night sleep.
