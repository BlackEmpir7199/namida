# Installation

# Note Regarding Tag Editor
- tag editor needs SAF (storage access framework) permission in order to edit metadata.
- usually u will have to set it for each folder that contains the desired track so there is like 2 options
    1. request saf permission everytime you are editing a track that isn't inside the folder having access (it will be always the last granted folder) 
    2. copy track to a specific folder (i chose backup folder), ask for permission, edit metadata, move the track back to the original path
- obviously i chose the second, this will cause the permission to reset if u changed default backup location. 

# Note Regarding waveform generation
- Currently, generating waveform takes ~8 seconds for a 3 min track, I'm limited by the technology of my time, though that being said, once the waveform is generated, it is cached permanently, meaning you will not have to wait again.
- Due to that, I've provided an option to generate all waveforms at once, maybe u can use it on a night sleep.
