# Video Integration
- Namida is capable of playing videos related to the music, video can be found either locally or fetched from youtube
<details>
<summary>how locally?</summary>
typically looks (inside the folders you specificed) for any matching title, matching goes as following:
<br>
-- Alan walker - Faded.m4a
<br>
-- video alAn WaLkER - faDed (480p).mp4
<br>
the video filename should contain at least one of the following:
 <br>
   1. the music filename as shown above.
 <br>
   2. title & first artist of the track.
<br>
note: some cleanup is made to improve the matching, all symbols & whitespaces are ignored.
</details>

<details>
<summary>how youtube?</summary>
 â€¢ looks up in the track comment tag (as they are mostly done by @yt-dlp) or filename for any matching youtube link, if found then it starts downloading (and caches permanently) and plays once it's ready, streaming here isn't a good idea as the priority goes for the music file itself.

# Installation

### Note Regarding Tag Editor
>- tag editor needs SAF (storage access framework) permission in order to edit metadata.
>- usually u will have to set it for each folder that contains the desired track so there is like 2 options
>    1. request saf permission everytime you are editing a track that isn't inside the folder having access (it will be always the last granted folder) 
>    2. copy track to a specific folder (i chose backup folder), ask for permission, edit metadata, move the track back to the original path
>- obviously i chose the second, this will cause the permission to reset if u changed default backup location. 

### Note Regarding waveform generation
>- Currently, generating waveform takes ~8 seconds for a 3 min track, I'm limited by the technology of my time, though that being said, once the waveform is generated, it is cached permanently, meaning you will not have to wait again.
>- Due to that, I've provided an option to generate all waveforms at once, maybe u can use it on a night sleep.

## - Permission Note:
### the following actions require <font size="1">`all_files_access`</font> permission (requested when needed)
>- respect .nomedia
>- editing audio tags
>- creating or restoring backups

### Special Thanks:
 >- @LucJosin for their jaudiotagger integration, which actually powers namida.
 >- @55nknown for their awesome miniplayer physics.
 >- @alexmercerind for helping me out a lot.
